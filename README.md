# The Lumia Programming Language
**The Lumia Programming Language** (or **Lumia** for short), is a simple programming language with the purpose of help beginners learn to code.
- **The Interpreter [(lumialang/lumia)](https://github.com/lumialang/lumia)** is the Lumia code interpreter, built using the rock-solid **Rust** programming language to mantain security when coding.

## Why Lumia?
*It depends on you.* **Lumia** is still in a **work-in-progress** state, and things can change. Maybe the language will just disappear without prior notice or maybe something really goes wrong and the developers can just give up.
> *Anything can happen. We at Lumia Staff say that everyone has the rights to choose and hope. Just don't screw it up.* - **The Lumia Project Leader**

So, if you have a hope in us, try contributing to this project by adding or fixing things, you can do anything (with limits, of course). If you contribute, you might be able to join the **The Lumia Project Staff**. *(But I don't guarantee anything.)*

## Contribute
As said before, you can contribute with **The Lumia Programming Language** by adding or fixing things in the code.

### How to contribute

### Notes
To compile and use **Lumia**, just use ``cargo`` with the command below:
